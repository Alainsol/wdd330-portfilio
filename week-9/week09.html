            <h3>The Browser Object Model</h3>
            <p>BOM stand for Browser Object Model is a browser-specific convention referring to all the objects exposed by the web browser.It is also hierarchy of browser objects that are used 
            to manipulate methods and properties associated with the Web browser itself. Objects that make up the BOM include the window object,
             navigator object, screen object, history,navigator,frames, location object, and the document object.So in one word BOM is the core of JavaScript on the web.It provides you with objects that expose the web browser’s functionality.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Window interface represents a window containing a DOM document; the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window.<br>
            A window for a given document can be obtained using the document.defaultView property.
            In one word BOM  is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.
            Every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object.
            </p>

      <h3>Cookie Expiry Dates</h3>
      <p>Cookies are session cookies by default. This means that they are deleted once a browser
        session is finished (when the user closes the browser tab or window). Cookies can be
        made persistent―that is, lasting beyond the browser session―by adding “;
        expires=date” to the end of the cookie when it is set, where date is a date value in the
        UTC String format Day, DD-Mon-YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT</p>

      <div class="timing">
        <h3>Timing Functions</h3>
        <p>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that
         are ignored by the browser. They’re also private to a page, so shouldn’t be used by an
         external service: their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program. This means that
         they are perfect for adding data to be used either by an external API or as a hook that the
         program utilizes to access a particular element on the page</p>

      <div class="Summary">
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>he window object is the global object in a browser.
            Global variables are actually properties of the window object.
            alert, confirm(), and prompt() are all methods of the window object, and open
            dialogs that halt the execution of the program.
            The navigator object gives information about the user’s browser and operating
            system, although it can be unreliable.
            The location object provides information about the URL of the current page.
            The history object keeps information about the pages that have been visited in the
            session.
            You can open, close, resize, and move windows (although, this doesn’t mean that you
            should!).
            The screen object provides information about the user’s screen.
            The document.write() is an archaic method of writing text to the document and
            should be avoided.
            Cookies can be used to store small pieces of information between requests using the
            document.cookie property.
            The window.setTimeout() method can be used to invoke a function after a set
            amount of time.
            The window.setInterval() method can be used to repeatedly invoke a function.</p>
