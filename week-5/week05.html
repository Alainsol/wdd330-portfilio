        <h3>Errors</h3>
        <p>Human made error , programming is used by Human, it therefore makes error. there are many ways that may occur the errors but ftollowing are mostly
            <br><strong>system error</strong>―there is problem with the system or external devices with which the
            program is interacting
            <br>
            <strong>programmer error</strong>―the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic.; it could
            even be as simple as a typo<br>
            <strong>User error</strong>―the user has entered data incorrectly that the program is unable to handle<br>
            In JavaScript when errors happen, when you test it with browser. <br>It will end the program immediately <br>
            <strong>  The good one that in javaScript is that it will warn before performing 
            JavaScript will also show a warning <br>if there is an error in the code that fails to stop the
            program from running. <br>This means that the program will continue to run after a warning;<br>
            this can be problematic, though, since the issue that produced the warning may cause the
            program to run incorrectly.</strong><br>
            example:
            pi = 3.142;<br>
            << JavaScript Warning: assignment to undeclared variable

        </p>
        <h3>Warning</h3>
        <p>JavaScript will act and  show a warning if there is an error in the code that fails to stop the
            program from running. This means that the program will continue to run after a warning;
            this can be problematic, though, since the issue that produced the warning may cause the
            program to run incorrectly.

    <div class="testing">
            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <p>Testing has a very primary objective to find effects .It evaluates the code and find error</p>
            <h3>Debugging</h3>
            <h3>Difference between Testing and Debugging</h3>
            <p>Testisting deals with finding defect while debugging  deals with analyzing the reported issue getting into the root cause of it
                and resolve it </p><br>
            
                <h3>Strict Mode</h3>
                <p>The syntax of view strict is a pragma that tells the browser to change the way  they execute Javascript .It helps users to write and safe code which will
                    approach the user to make less mistake<br>It
                    eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.
                    Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations <br>
                    Strict mode simply requires the following string to be added to the first line of a JavaScript file:
                                            <strong>“use strict”;</strong>

                                            function strictly(){
                                                “use strict”;
                                                }
                                                
                    </p>
                    <h3>Linting Tools</h3>
                    Linting tools such as JS Lint, JS Hint, and ES Lint can be used to test the quality of
                    JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode. They are designed to highlight any
                    sloppy programming practices or syntax errors.
        
        <h3>Exception</h3>
        <p>Exception
            Runtime errors, also called exceptions, occur during execution (after compilation/interpretation).It is abnormal condition which occur during teh execution of 
            a program,it dirupts normal flow of the program.<br>
            It also produces a return value that can be used by the program to deal with the error
            A Stack trace is a list of the method calls that the application was in the middle of when an Exception was thrown.<br>- 
            Warnings - warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash
            -- this can be a problem if the program runs incorrectly but still runs
            Because it is loosely typed some errors can slip through the code, you can enforce a strict mode -> 'use strict';
            -- this will make it throw an exception instead of a warning (if the engine will accept the mode)
            In can be used in a function or a strict function that will run the whole program code.</p>

            <h3>Debugging in the browser</h3> 
            Here where we check if the things are running properly when they are implemented<br>
            
            function amIOldEnough(age){<br>
                alert(age);
                if (age < 12) {<br>
                return “No, sorry.”;

                }<br>
                 else if (age < 18) {<br>
                return “Only if you are accompanied by an adult.”;
                }<br>
                else 
                <br>{
                return “Yep, come on in!”;<br>
                }
                }
            </div>
        </div>

    <h3>Summary Chapter10</h3>
    Chapter Summary
- Novice to Ninja JavaScript
<p>Bugs are unavoidable in code, and it’s best to find them early rather than later.
JavaScript can be put into strict mode using the string "use strict" . This can be used in a whole file or just a single function.
Linting tools can be used to ensure your code follows good practice and conventions.
Feature detection can check whether a method is supported before calling it, helping to avoid an exception being thrown.
The console and browser’s built-in debugging tool can be used to interactively find and fix bugs in code.
Exceptions can be thrown using the throw statement.
An error object is created when an exception occurs.
Any code placed inside a try block will pass any error objects to a catch block when an exception occurs. Any code inside a finally block will run if an exception does or does not occur.
Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then writing the code that passes the test, then refactoring the code every time a new feature is implemented</p>
