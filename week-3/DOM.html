<body>
    <p>Every id attribute should be unique to just one element, so this method will return a
        reference to that element. For this reason, it’s a very quick way of finding elements in a
        document. It is also supported in all the major browsers.
        If no element exists with the given ID, null is returned.</p>

 //Getting an Element by Its ID

    title = document.getElementById('title');
//Get Elements by Their Tag Name
    paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName('p'); 

//Get Elements by Their Class Name
    document.getElementsByClassName('swim');
//There is only one element on the page that has the class name of swim, but a node list
//(with a length of 1) will still be returned:
//.length determine the number of element that you use in the classe
    document.getElementsByClassName('swim').length;
    document.getElementsByClassName('walk').length;
 0
//To access the paragraph element node, we use the index notation to refer to the first
//element in the collection:
swim = document.getElementsByClassName('swim')[0];
  clas ='swim'
   
//The className Property

//Classes of an Element
 // className property that allows the class of an element to be set
//directly. In addition, it can be used to find out the value of the class attribute:

    swim.className;
    'swimming'
//We can change the class back to swim with the following code:

    swim.className = 'swim'
    'swim'

//The classList Property
//The classList property is a list of all the classes an element has. It has a number of
//methods that make it easier to modify the class of an element. It’s supported in all modern
//browsers and in Internet Explorer from version 10 onwards.
//The add method works in a similar way to the addClass function we created above, and
//can be used to add a class to an element. For example, we could add a class of “sport” to
//the run element:
    run.classList.add('run');

//The remove method will remove a specific class from an element. For example, we could
//remove the class of “swim” from the swim element:
    swim.classList.remove('swim');


    swim.classList.toggle('sport'); // will remove the ‘sport’ class false
    swim.classList.toggle('sport'); // will add the ‘sport’ class back
    true
//The contains method will check to see if an element has a particular class:
    swim.classList.contains('sport');
    true
    swim.classList.toggle('sport');
    false
    swim.classList.contains('sport');
    false



//: Adding Classes in Old Versions of Internet Explorer
    function addClass(element,newClass){
        if (element.className) {
        element.className = swim.className +  '' + newClass;
        } else {
        element.className = newClass;
        }
        return element.getAttribute('class');
        }
 
//creating element
    var newPara = document.createElement('p');
//Creating a Text Node
    var text = document.createTextNode('Transition 1');
//Appending Nodes
    newPara.appendChild(text);
    function createElement (tag,text) {
    el = document.createElement(tag);
    el.textContent = text;
return el
}
//Query Selectors
/*The document.querySelector() method allows you to use CSS notation to find the first
element in the document that matches a CSS query selector criteria provided as an
argument. If no elements match, it will return null.
The document.querySelectorAll() method also uses CSS notation but returns a node list
of all the elements in the document that match the CSS query selector. If no elements
match, it will return an empty node list.
These are both very powerful methods that can emulate all the methods discussed, as well
as allowing more fine-grained control over which element nodes are returned.*/

//For example
bike = document.querySelector('#bike');
 id='bike'
//this could be used instead of 'document.getElementsByClassName'
/*The document.querySelectorAll() method also uses CSS notation but returns a node list
of all the elements in the document that match the CSS query selector. If no elements
match, it will return an empty node list.*/
//difference between .querySelector() and.querySelectorAll()
//.querySelector():return first node,it doesn't matter how many nodes you have 
//.querySelectorAll(): return all nodes (class, tag , id ...)


/*

the main goal of this chapter is to interact and change or modify 
the html document that is to be displayed (rendered) on the web browser.
In one word .querlySelector(), and .querySelectorAll() are
very power over .getElementById(), getElementtagName(),getElementClassName()

//Events

//Events are another part of the DOM API and they are what provides the link between the
//web page and user interactions. Every time a user interacts with a web page, such as
//clicking on a link, pressing a key, or moving a mouse, an event occurs that our program
//can detect and then respond to

//In my own word :Events is the way how user interact with html 
//example user touche the mouse and act(click) upon it after that the user take its own decision if he is going to act or not 


/* Event listeners in JavaScript work in much the same way. They are like setting a
notification to alert you when something happens
s. Instead of the program having to
constantly check to see if an event has occurred, the event listener will let it know when
the event happens and the program can then respond appropriately. The program can get
on with the tasks while it waits for the event to happen.
For example, say in your program you want something to happen when a user clicks on
the page. The code to check if a user has clicked might look like this example (JavaScript
doesn’t actually work like this, so this code would fail to work, although it is the way
some applications work):*/
if (click) {
doSomething();
} else;

document.body.addEventListener('click', function(){
alert('You Clicked!')
}) 
/*In this  example, the event listener has been added to the document’s
body element. It will call the function doSomething when any part of the page is clicked */

// inline event attributes
//this means that you interact at the html markup 
// example <p onclick='console.log(‘You Clicked!')>Click Me</p>

//event listner this means you interact at JavaScript


/*The addEventListener() method is called on a node object, the node to which the event
listener is being applied. This code will attach an event listener to the
document’s body:*/

//Example 
document.body.addEventListener('click',doSomething);
