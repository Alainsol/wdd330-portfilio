<p>Summary
    In this chapter, we have learned the following:
    Events occur when a user interacts with a web page.
    An event listener is attached to a node, watches for an event to happen and then
    invokes a callback function.
    The event object is passed to the callback function as an argument, and contains lots
    of properties and methods about the event.
    There are many types of event, including mouse events, keyboard events, and touch
    events.
    You can remove an event using the removeEventListener method.
    The default behavior of elements can be prevented using the preventDefault()
    function.
    Event propagation is the order that the events fire on each element.
    Event delegation is when an event listener is added to a parent element to capture
    events that happen to its children elements.</p>
