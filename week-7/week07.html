            <h2>Introduction to functional programming</h2>
            
            <p>In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, which means that they behave the same
               way as every other value  So they can have their own properties and methods, as well as
               accepting other functions as parameters and being returned by other functions. This makes
               them a very flexible tool to work with in JavaScript, and there are a variety of techniques
               and patterns that can be used to make code cleaner.<br>
               <strong>Example of a random() function that will return a random integer between two
               arguments, a and b; if only one argument is supplied, it will return a random number
               between 1 and that argument’s value:</strong><br>
               <strong> random(a,b) {<br>
               if (b === undefined) b = a, a = 1;<br>
               // if only one argument is<br>
               supplied, assume the lower limit is 1<br>
               return Math.floor((b-a+1) * Math.random()) + a;<br>
               }<br>
               random(6);<br>
               << 4<br>
               random(10,20);<br>
               << 13</strong>

         <h3>Function Properties and Methods</h3>
         <p>Property is a way to get certain relevant information about object likely variable and arrays <br>
            while methode is a way to do something to the data inside the actual container
         </p>
            var person = {
            fullName: function() {<br>
            return this. firstName + "" + this.lastName;<br>
            }
            }
            var personA = {<br>
            firstName: "John",<br>
            lastName: "Doe",<br>
            id: 5566<br>
            }
            var personB = {<br>
            firstName: "David",<br>
            lastName: "Doe",<br>
            id: 5577<br>
            fullName: function() {<br>
            persnon.fullName.call(personA);<br> 
            //will return"John Doe"<br>
         }<br>
         };
         
      </div>
      <div class="functionReturnFunction">
         <h3>functions that return functions</h3>
         <p>As functions are first-class objects is that they can accept a function as an argument as
            well as return another function
            <br>
            It allows generic higher-order functions to
            be used to return more specific functions based on particular parameters
            <br>
            Example<br>
            . For example, we can create a power() function that returns a function that calculates values to the power of
            a given parameter:<br>
            function power(x) {<br>
            return function(power) {<br>
            return Math.pow(x,power);<br>
            }}
            Now we can create some more specific functions that use this generic function to build
            them. For example, <br>we could implement a twoExp() function that returns powers of 2, like<br>
            twoExp = power(2);<br>
            << function (power) {<br>
            return Math.pow(x,power)<br>;
            }<br>
            twoExp(5);<br>
            << 32<br>
            We can create another function called tenExp() that returns powers of 10:<br>
            tenExp = power(10);<br>
            << function (power) {<br>
            return Math.pow(x,power);<br>
            }
            tenExp(6);
            << 1000000<br>
            If a function returns another function, instead of assigning the returned function to a
            variable then calling it, the returned function can be invoked immediately using double
            parentheses:<br>
            power(3)(5);<br>
            << 243<br>
         </p>
      </div>
      <div class="callbacks">
         <h3>Callbacks</h3>
         <p>Callbacks is when you nest a function inside another function as an argument<br>
            function one (){<br>
            console.log("step 1. please call step 2");<br>
            call_two()<br>
            }
            function two(){<br>
            console.log('step 2');<br>
            }<br>
            //we gonna make connection in between two functions<br>
            one(two)
         </p>
         <h3>Recursive Functions</h3>
         <p>A recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met.<br>

            function factorial(n) {<br>
               if (n === 0) {<br>
               return 1<br>
               } else {<br>
               return n * factorial(n - 1);<br>
               }
               }
            
         </p>
         <h3>Closure</h3>
         <p>A closure is a block of code that can be referenced (and passed around)
            with access to the variables of the enclosing scope.
            A closure is a function that references variables in the outer scope from its inner scope. The closure preserves the outer scope inside its inner scope.
            To understand the closures, you need to know how the lexical scoping works first.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>Example<br>
            function greeting(message) {<br>
            return function(name){<br>
            return message + ' ' + name;<br>
            }<br>
            }<br>
            let sayHi = greeting('Hi');<br>
            let sayHello = greeting('Hello');<br>
            console.log(sayHi('John')); // Hi John<br>
            console.log(sayHello('John')); // Hello John<br>
         </p>
         <h3>Currying</h3>
         <p>Currying is a process that involves the partial application of functions<br>
         <p>function multiplier(x,y) {<br>
            if (y === undefined) {<br>
            return function(z) {<br>
            return x * z;<br>
            }<br>
            } else {<br>
            return x * y;<br>
            }<br>
            }</p>
      </div>
      <div class="ajax">
         <h3>Summary chp 11</h3>
         <p>Functional programming involves breaking processes down into steps that can be
            applied as a series of functions.
            Functions can return other functions.
            Functions have built-in properties such as length, but can have custom properties
            added.
            All functions have call() and apply() methods that can be used to apply the
            function to different objects.
            A callback is a function that’s provided as an argument to another function. They can
            be used to create event-driven asynchronous code that enables a program to continue
            running while waiting for an event to happen.
            A closure is the process of keeping a reference to a variable available outside the
            scope of the function it was originally defined in.
            Immediately Invoked Function Expressions or IIFEs are functions that are enclosed
            in parentheses and immediately followed by double parentheses so that they’re
            invoked. They are useful for setting default values.
            Functions are able to dynamically redefine themselves in the body of the function,
            depending on certain conditions.
            A recursive function will keep invoking itself until a certain condition is met.
            Currying or partial application is the process of applying one argument at a time to a
            function. A new function is returned until all the arguments have been used.

         <H1>What is Ajax?</H1>
         <p> <strong>AJAX stands for  ASYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT AND XML</strong><br>
            Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server
            and dynamically updates web pages without reloading. This enables data to be sent and
            received in the background, as well as portions of a page to be updated in response to user
            events, while the rest of the program continues to run.In ome word AJax is web development echnique
            It also means of loading data from the server and selectively updating parts
            of a web page without reloading the whole page.Basically, what Ajax does is make use of the browser's 
            built-in XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object to send and receive information to and from a web server asynchronously, in the background, without blocking the page or interfering with the user's experience.

               <h3>Summary Chapter13</h3>
               <p >
                  AJAX is not a programming language.<br>
                  AJAX is a technique for accessing web servers from a web page.<br>
                  AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.<br>
                  Ajax is a technique for sending and receiving data asynchronously in the background.<br>
                  The data can be sent in many forms, but it is usually inJSON.<br>
                  Ajax can be used for making partial page updates without having to do a full pagereload.<br>
                  Ajax can be used for communicating with external APIs.<br>
                  Ajax requests are made using instances of the XMLHttpRequest object.<br>
                  Requests can receive data using a GET request or send data using a POST request.<br>
                  JSONP or JSON with Padding is a technique used to bypass the same-origin policy.<br>
                  It wraps the response data in a JavaScript callback function that is dynamically inserted
                  the markup.
