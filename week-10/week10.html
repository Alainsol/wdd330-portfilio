            <h3>What is Validation?</h3>
               <p>Validating Forms
                  is the process of checking whether a user has entered the
            information into a form correctly.A required field is completed.An email address is valid.A number is entered when numerical data is required.A password is at least a minimum number of characters
            Form validation is something you find on most websites where you either sign up for or create an account for. You will need to provide things such as emails or passwords. Form validation makes sure that the user inputs the right things in the right places.
            <br>Example<br>
            <input type='text' id='heroName' name='heroName'<br>
            ➥ autofocus placeholder='Your Super Hero Name' maxlength=32<br>
            ➥ required.</p><br>

               <h3>Summary</h3>
               <p>Forms are the primary method used for entering data into a browser.<br>
                  Forms have a variety of controls that are used for entering different types of information.<br>
                  HTML5 has a large number of new input types that are beginning to be implemented in modern browsers.document.forms will return an HTML collection of all the forms on a page.
                  form.elements will return an HTML collection of all the elements containedwithin a form.<br>
                  Forms have focus, blur, and change events that fire as a user interacts with
                  the form.<br>
                  Forms also have a submit event that can be used to intercept a form before it’s
                  been submitted.<br>
                  The information entered into a form can be read or updated using the value
                  property of the form controls.<br>
                  The HTML5 form validation API can be used to automatically validate a form,
                  but only at a basic level, so a custom validation script may be required.<br>
                  In the next chapter, we’ll be taking a look at the window object.</p><br>

               <h3>Fetch</h3>
               <p>The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, 
                  logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.<br>
                  Syntax Fetch<br>
                  fetch(resource)<br>
                  fetch(resource, init)<br><hr>

                  The global fetch() method starts the process of fetching a resource from the network, returning a promise which is fulfilled once the response is available.
